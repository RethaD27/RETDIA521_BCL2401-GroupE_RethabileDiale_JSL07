## Reflection
This project provided a practical opportunity to apply HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts to create a useful web application. Here are some reflections on the project:

User Experience: Creating a user-friendly interface and providing instant feedback upon form submission enhances the user experience and makes the application more intuitive to use.

Modal Implementation: Implementing a modal for displaying the generated certificates adds a layer of interactivity and improves the overall presentation of the application.

Future Improvements: In future iterations, I could enhance the project by adding features such as custom styling options for the certificates, downloading the generated certificates as PDF files, and implementing form validation to ensure data integrity.

Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience and provided a foundation for further exploration of web development concepts and techniques.
